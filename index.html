      <h3>Project 1</h3>
      <h2>Title : Detecting Attacked IoT Sensors Using SVM</h2>
<p>Description : The project aims to build a clear classifier to find the boundary between regular and mutated IoT sensor data. The project uses the dataset named IoT sensor data of a smart home system. The project uses the Supervised Classification Algorithm Support Vector Machine and check its performance and accuracy using Linear, Polynomial.

      <h3>Project 2</h3>
      <h2>Title : Malicious Software Detection system Using Machine Learning</h2>
<p align="left">Description : The practice of classifying malware based on its families and signatures is known as malware classification. This research focuses on categorizing newly discovered malware based on attributes that are shared by malware that is similar to it. This study suggests a unique approach that can find fresh malware samples for analysis and classify malware samples into their families. Three different machine learning classification approaches are employed for this. Two separate tools are used in the analysis to produce more comparative and, consequently, accurate classification findings. The proposed effort can aid in the detection of novel malware, its subsequent removal, and its classification into families. It is examined whether the family classification of malware is accurate and confusion-free. Analysis follows evaluation and Random Forest provides us with the highest accuracy.
